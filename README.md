# DataJournalism
I picked the question "Is it rude to recline your seat on a plane?" to understand the opinions of respondents, to see what majority thinks of their fellow recliners. I chose a horiztonal bar chart to show the difference in opinions.
The data shows that more than half of the respondents believe that no, it is not rude to recline a seat which relieves some of my perception anxiety.
